        "question": "Do I really need to continue taking YOMZ after a couple of months or so?",
        "answer": "No, you donâ€™t. Our mission is to end Hidden Hunger for 100 million people by 2030. If it happens because families take their YOMZ daily for the next 3 years, then great. But if it happens because by taking YOMZ, you and your family were inspired to transform your lives by overhauling your diet, exercise routine, nutritional awareness, etc., then thatâ€™s great, too. We just want to help you however we can."
    },
    {
        "question": "Will it target gut health, low energy, and decreased focus?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. We carefully curated the ingredients in YOMZ with an eye toward gut health. We knew, and research backs this up, that if we help improve the gut health of your family, it would directly lead to better energy and focus."
    },
    {
        "question": "How about helping with brain function, immunity, even heart health?",
        "answer": "Yes. Again, everything starts with improved gut health. In fact, thereâ€™s a direct link between gut health and brain function. Similarly, better gut health is critical for a more robust immune system and a stronger heart."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is it safe for kids?",
        "answer": "Yes. Family is one of our 3 core values, so it has to be safe for ages 2 to 102. Thatâ€™s why YOMZ has only 1g of added sugar and no artificial dyes. Itâ€™s free of GMOs, gluten, and dairy plus keto-friendly and vegan."
    },
    {
        "question": "Will YOMZ help me lose weight?",
        "answer": "Letâ€™s be clear, YOMZ is not a weight loss gummy. Even if you take 2-3 servings per day. However, if YOMZ helps you and your family be more activeâ€¦ If it causes you to reduce how much processed foods you eatâ€¦ Or if by helping improve your immune system or kidsâ€™ growth and development, YOMZ helps you become strongerâ€¦ then who knows what other results are possible? ðŸ˜‰"
    },
    {
        "question": "What if I donâ€™t notice a difference â€” is there a guarantee?",
        "answer": "It would be a shame. Thatâ€™s why we have the most ridiculously iron-clad guarantee youâ€™ll find anywhere. If you donâ€™t absolutely love YOMZ, simply reach out to us within 90 days and weâ€™ll cheerfully refund double what you paid. Itâ€™s the YOMZ 90-Day Picky Momz 200% Happiness Guarantee. We take on all the risk so you can try it with total peace of mind. The worst thatâ€™ll happen is you double your investment in 90 days. Not even Wall St. can guarantee that."
    },
    {
        "question": "Will I have to change my familyâ€™s diet or meals or snack routine?",
        "answer": "Not at all. Itâ€™s really up to you and your family. If you donâ€™t change anything, you can still rest easier knowing youâ€™re leveling up your nutrition. Thatâ€™s a win right there. But thereâ€™s a very good chance that the mere daily routine of filling those nutrition gaps with YOMZ will lead to eating better. Once you start filling your nutrition needs, cravings for junk vanish. So play it by ear and your heart will know if change is good."
    },
    {
        "question": "How many bags do I need for my family?",
        "answer": "One bag of YOMZ is filled with 28 packs. Each pack equals a daily serving for 1 person. So 1 family member = 1 bag of nutrition for 28 days. So how bags you need depends on how many family members you want to help."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why is it priced lower than your competitors?",
        "answer": "YOMZ has no competition, first and foremost. Itâ€™s a unicorn. No other gummy delivers amazing taste thatâ€™s also packed with antioxidants, vitamins, micronutrients, and 9g of fiber. As for price, there is no middleman. Weâ€™re making this offer directly to you. Because we donâ€™t have to pay a middleman to offer it or sell it to you, weâ€™re passing the savings on to you. On top of that, our mission is to end Hidden Hunger for 100 million people by 2030. Thereâ€™s no way we could do that if we jacked up the price. This philosophy will never change. Itâ€™s the foundation of YOMZ."
