        "question": "How long does it take to receive my order?",
        "answer": "With Standard Shipping, your order should arrive in 3-5 days. However, we’ve noticed many families want it sooner, so there’s an option for expedited shipping.  This means it should arrive in 2 days."
    },
    {
        "question": "Where is YOMZ manufactured?",
        "answer": "We’re proud to manufacture our tasty gummies in the USA. We use premium ingredients in our state-of-the-art facility, which is FDA-registered and GMP-certified. Then YOMZ is 3rd-party tested to ensure top-shelf quality."
    },
    {
        "question": "What if YOMZ is not for me - is there a refund?",
        "answer": "Your order today is protected by our 90-Day Picky Momz 200% Happiness Guarantee. We’re so confident in the real food-based nutrition inside every YOMZ gummy that we’re sure you won’t need it. But you deserve ZERO stress when fighting for your family’s health, so here’s how it works: If you don’t see a difference in your family’s focus, digestion, energy, even your kid’s tantrum tempo… If they taste it and give you the dreaded thumbs down… Or if YOMZ doesn’t feel like the win you needed… You get back double what you paid."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does YOMZ really taste that good?",
        "answer": "Yes, it does. In our experience, no matter how healthy something is, it doesn’t matter if it doesn’t taste good - because who’ll want to eat it every day. So we craft YOMZ flavor-first. Besides, with a name like YOMZ, it has to taste phenomenal. And it does. "
    },
    {
        "question": "Is it safe for kids?",
        "answer": "Yes. Family is one of our 3 core values, so it has to be safe for ages 2 to 102. That’s why YOMZ has no artificial dyes, flavors, or other junk. It’s free of GMOs, gluten, and dairy plus vegan-friendly."
    },
    {
        "question": "How many bags do I need for my family?",
        "answer": "One bag of YOMZ is filled with 28 packs. Each pack equals a daily serving for 1 person. So 1 family member = 1 bag of nutrition for 28 days. So how many bags you need depends on how many family members you want to help."
